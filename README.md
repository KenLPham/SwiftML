# MobileMind Framework
Trainable Neural Network for iOS

## Background
I decided to create this framework because I wanted to be able to personalize the network for the user as they used my app. However, CoreML 2 doesn't offer this functionality and CoreML 3 was introduced while I was working on this, but those models only support iOS 13.

I wrote this as someone who is new to the whole machine learning thing, this is all based off of what I learned [here](https://github.com/KenLPham/MobileMind).
